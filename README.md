## 📌 About This Version (v1)

This is the **original VoidMeet** application — a full-stack real-time video chat app built using WebRTC, PeerJS, and Socket.IO.

It was my first major WebRTC project and includes:

- 🎥 Real-time video & audio calls (WebRTC + PeerJS)
- 👥 Join/Create meeting rooms
- 🖥️ Screen sharing
- 💬 Live chat using Socket.IO
- 🔐 Basic login/signup authentication
- 🕘 Meeting history stored in MongoDB
- 📱 Fully responsive UI with plain CSS

> This version helped me learn WebRTC, peer connections, socket events, room logic, and real-time communication patterns.
